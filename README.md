# ARDrone

drone-control.js is a basic javascript file used to control an ARDrone via the keyboard. It uses node-ar-drone https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone/) and nodejs. 

ar_drone.cpp allows an ARDrone to be controlled using individual UDP packets through C++. Currently speeds may only be set as {-0.05,-0.1,-0.2,-0.5,0.05,0.1,0.2 or 0.5}. An example of how to run will be uploaded shortly.
